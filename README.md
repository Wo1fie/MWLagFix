# MWLagFix

To resolve issues where CoD: Modern Warfare causes all other applications to freeze during shader processing on startup.  This will cause the shader processing to be slightly slower, but will allow other programs to be usable.

# Usage
* Start MWLagFix.exe
* Press 1
* Start Call of Duty: Modern Warfare

You can then hit Ctrl+C to stop forcing priority, then press 1-4 to select priority for gameplay.  Default is 4 (High Priority).
